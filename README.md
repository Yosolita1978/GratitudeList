## Project Overview

In this project, I'm using a very simple FaltList to show items. The idea is to use the Gratitude Journal therapy to build a basic react native app. The user can add inputs using a modal, and if the list item is touched, it will be deleted, and it will be updated.

## What did I learn?

Through this project:

-   Learn how to pass information between components
-   Practice styling react-native components
-   Working with Flex for design

Hi! My name is Cristina Rodriguez, and I am a software engineer. I received training from Hackbright Academy, an engineering bootcamp for women in San Francisco (graduation: March 2017). I was a recipient of the 2018 Grow Scholarship from Google and Udacity for Android Basics, and I have five apps in the Google Store. Now I'm studying the basics of react-native to be able to publish my apps in IOs too. I'm currently seeking a front-end developer role in the Greater Seattle Area. If you have a position that I should hear about, feel free to email yosola at Gmail.
